<p>This timeout uses a background thread to take action exactly when the timeout occurs. Use this to
implement timeouts where they aren't supported natively, such as to sockets that are blocked on
writing.</p>
<p>Subclasses should override <a href="timed-out.html">timedOut</a> to take action when a timeout occurs. This method will be
invoked by the shared watchdog thread so it should not do any long-running operations. Otherwise
we risk starving other timeouts from being triggered.</p>
<p>Use <a href="sink.html">sink</a> and <a href="source.html">source</a> to apply this timeout to a stream. The returned value will apply the
timeout to each operation on the wrapped stream.</p>
<p>Callers should call <a href="enter.html">enter</a> before doing work that is subject to timeouts, and <a href="exit.html">exit</a> afterwards.
The return value of <a href="exit.html">exit</a> indicates whether a timeout was triggered. Note that the call to
<a href="timed-out.html">timedOut</a> is asynchronous, and may be called after <a href="exit.html">exit</a>.</p>
