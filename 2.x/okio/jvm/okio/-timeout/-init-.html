<p>A policy on how much time to spend on a task before giving up. When a task times out, it is left
in an unspecified state and should be abandoned. For example, if reading from a source times out,
that source should be closed and the read should be retried later. If writing to a sink times
out, the same rules apply: close the sink and retry later.</p>
<h3>Timeouts and Deadlines</h3>
<p>This class offers two complementary controls to define a timeout policy.</p>
<p><strong>Timeouts</strong> specify the maximum time to wait for a single operation to complete. Timeouts are
typically used to detect problems like network partitions. For example, if a remote peer doesn't
return <em>any</em> data for ten seconds, we may assume that the peer is unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlines</strong> specify the maximum time to spend on a job, composed of one or more operations. Use
deadlines to set an upper bound on the time invested on a job. For example, a battery-conscious
app may limit how much time it spends pre-loading content.</p>
