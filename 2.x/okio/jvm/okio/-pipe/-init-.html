<p>A source and a sink that are attached. The sink's output is the source's input. Typically each
is accessed by its own thread: a producer thread writes data to the sink and a consumer thread
reads data from the source.</p>
<p>This class uses a buffer to decouple source and sink. This buffer has a user-specified maximum
size. When a producer thread outruns its consumer the buffer fills up and eventually writes to
the sink will block until the consumer has caught up. Symmetrically, if a consumer outruns its
producer reads block until there is data to be read. Limits on the amount of time spent waiting
for the other party can be configured with <a href="../-timeout/index.html">timeouts</a> on the source and the
sink.</p>
<p>When the sink is closed, source reads will continue to complete normally until the buffer has
been exhausted. At that point reads will return -1, indicating the end of the stream. But if the
source is closed first, writes to the sink will immediately fail with an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/IOException.html">IOException</a>.</p>
